          <h4>Gamers Outreach</h4>
          <p>
            This project was centered around redesigning the Gamers Outreach
            website in order to make it more usable for potential fundraising
            partners, with a primary focus on those within the esports
            entertainment industry. By granting streamers access to Gamers
            Outreachâ€™s charity streaming information, more streamers would be
            able to raise funds for the organization using our redesign.

            This app was aimed at solving the problem "Persons who live in
            multi-person households and share grocery shopping responsibilities
            face communication and coordination challenges that may result in
            unnecessary purchases, overspending, wasted time, or missed
            purchases." We brainstormed solutions and conducted user testing and
            research in an attempt to create a solution.
